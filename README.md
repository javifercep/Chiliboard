# Chiliboard
The Chiliboard is an Arduino form factor board with two CAN - 2.0B interfaces. It is based on STM32F105 MCU and can work as an extension of the [Noodleboard](https://github.com/javifercep/Noodleboard). It has been developed for the [MuBA](http://javisfryingchips.com/portfolio/detail/multi-bus-analyzer/) project.
